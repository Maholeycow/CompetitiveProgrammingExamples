# CompetitiveProgrammingExamples

I can't post the questions because they are proprietary to TopCoder, but I just want
to give more examples of my work and my adventure into competitive programming.

HOWEVER, if you go to TopCoder and just search in the practice section the names of the
problems, you can see the problem I answered, I will also give how many points I scored.
I may happen to forget to update the time/memory constraint as they change from problem to 
problem, so if something seems way off in that relation, it probably is :)
